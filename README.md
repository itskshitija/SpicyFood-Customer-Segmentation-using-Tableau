# üòãSpicyFood - Customer Segmentation: RFM Analysis using Tableau


## Checkout my medium article [Here](https://medium.com/@kshitijachilbule2/spicyfood-exploring-customer-segmentation-with-a-tableau-dashboard-1167eed99ca2)

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a Customer Segmentation Dashboard for SpicyFood Management using Tableau. The goal is to classify customers into meaningful segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographics, enabling the business to make informed, data-driven decisions.

Using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, customers are grouped into categories such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, Promising, and At Risk, among others. These segments provide insights into customer value, engagement, and retention opportunities.

The analysis incorporates factors like age, customer tiers, and average bill per customer to better understand customer patterns. The provided dataset includes essential details like Customer ID, Purchase Frequency, Bill Amount, Recency, and other relevant attributes.

The final Tableau dashboard delivers an interactive and visually appealing representation of these insights, helping SpicyFood Management to:
- Identify high-value customers.
- Re-engage at-risk customers.
- Enhance retention strategies.
- Optimize marketing campaigns.

## üìäüçúInsights

### Customer Segmentation Breakdown
- #### Champions
  - These customers make up 22% of the customer base and contribute to the majority of revenue.
  - They are frequent buyers with high spending and recent purchases, making them ideal for loyalty programs or exclusive offers.

- #### Loyal Customers
  - This group consistently makes repeat purchases and represents a significant portion of long-term revenue.
  - Retaining them through rewards or early access to products can strengthen their loyalty even further.

### Growth Opportunities
- #### Potential Loyalist
  - Customers in this group show high potential to become Champions.
  - Strategies such as personalized marketing or small incentives (e.g., free shipping or discounts) could encourage them to purchase more frequently.

- #### Promising Customers
  - These are new or occasional buyers with medium spending levels.
  - Engaging them through follow-ups, product recommendations, or introductory offers can drive higher retention.

### At-Risk Customers
- This segment includes customers with low recent activity but medium or high spending in the past.
- Re-engagement campaigns, such as email reminders, exclusive discounts, or personalized offers, could win them back.

### Demographics and Spending Patterns
- Champions, Potential Loyal Customers, and Promising are predominantly Teenagers, indicating a strong purchasing power in this demographic.
- #### Gender Insights
  - Male customers slightly dominate the Champion segment, while females are more prevalent in the Potential Loyalist and Promising groups.

### Behavioural Insights
- Loyal Customers and Champions have the highest spending levels, and their purchase frequency shows consistent growth.

### Retention Strategies
- For **Champions**: Strengthen their loyalty through VIP programs, exclusive offers, or early product launches.
- For **At-Risk Customers**: Focus on reactivation campaigns, leveraging discounts, or reminding them of past positive experiences.
- For **Promising Customers**: Engage them with welcome campaigns or personalized product recommendations to build trust.
