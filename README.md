## Insights

### Customer Segmentation Breakdown
- #### Champions
  - These customers make up 22% of the customer base and contribute to the majority of revenue.
  - They are frequent buyers with high spending and recent purchases, making them ideal for loyalty programs or exclusive offers.

- #### Loyal Customers
  - This group consistently makes repeat purchases and represents a significant portion of long-term revenue.
  - Retaining them through rewards or early access to products can strengthen their loyalty even further.

### Growth Opportunities
- #### Potential Loyalist
  - Customers in this group show high potential to become Champions.
  - Strategies such as personalized marketing or small incentives (e.g., free shipping or discounts) could encourage them to purchase more frequently.

- #### Promising Customers
  - These are new or occasional buyers with medium spending levels.
  - Engaging them through follow-ups, product recommendations, or introductory offers can drive higher retention.

### At-Risk Customers
- This segment includes customers with low recent activity but medium or high spending in the past.
- Re-engagement campaigns, such as email reminders, exclusive discounts, or personalized offers, could win them back.

### Demographics and Spending Patterns
- Champions, Potential Loyal Customers, and Promising are predominantly Teenagers, indicating a strong purchasing power in this demographic.
- #### Gender Insights
  - Male customers slightly dominate the Champion segment, while females are more prevalent in the Potential Loyalist and Promising groups.

### Behavioural Insights
- Loyal Customers and Champions have the highest spending levels, and their purchase frequency shows consistent growth.

### Retention Strategies
- For **Champions**: Strengthen their loyalty through VIP programs, exclusive offers, or early product launches.
- For **At-Risk Customers**: Focus on reactivation campaigns, leveraging discounts, or reminding them of past positive experiences.
- For **Promising Customers**: Engage them with welcome campaigns or personalized product recommendations to build trust.
